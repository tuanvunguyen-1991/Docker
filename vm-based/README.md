## Objectives
 In this example, I'm using immutable infra flow pattern with **Packer**, **Terraform**, **Ansible** and **Jenkins** to build simple webapp application (nginx + simple tomcat webapp).

 What will you learn from this example
- How to use **Jenkinfile**, Docker-based Jenkin Agents
- How to use Infrastructure as Code tool like **Terraform** and **Packer**
- How to use Config Management tool like **Ansible** with config rendered from **Terraform**

## Introduction
- This example includes 3 main components: bastion, web (Nginx) behind an ALB, Tomcat (SampleWebApp).
- **Packaging-Image** job creates pre-defined AMIs using Packer and Ansible
- **Infra-deployment** job creates AWS infra with baked AMIs using Terraform
- Ansible configuration is rendered from Terraform and uses proxypass command via Bastion host to manage servers

## 1. Prequisites
- Software version information

| Software| Version  |
|--|--|
| OS |Ubuntu 18.04  |
| Packer |1.5.6  |
| Terraform |0.12.24  |
| Ansible|latest  |

### 1.1. Install Jenkins + Docker
- Install [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/linux/), [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)

### 1.2. Setup AWS credentials on Jenkins
- To work with AWS, we need to have credential information.
- To be simple, I use ACCESS  and SECRET KEY (equivalent to **PACKER_AWS_ACCESS_KEY** and **PACKER_AWS_SECRET_KEY**)

## 2. How to deploy
### 2.1. Packaging images with Packer
- Create  **Packaging-Image** job

- Run **Packaging-Image** job to build AMI, n

### 2.2. Infra Deployment
- Create  **Infra-deployment** job

- Run **Infra-deployment** job to provision infra and deploy application

## 3. Verify deployment
- Get **lb_dns** from Jenkin Output after running **infra-deployment** job

- Visit to **lb_dns**, it should show the **SampleWebApp** page

## 4. Cleanup
- Run infra-deployment job with **cleanup** parameter
